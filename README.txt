== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I bundle Page Builder with my theme? =

Yes, provided your theme is licensed under GPL or a compatible license. If you're publishing your theme on ThemeForest, you must select the GPL license instead of their regular license.

Pace Builder is actively developed and updated, so generally I'd recommend that you have your users install the original plugin so they can receive updates. You can try [TGM Plugin Activation](http://tgmpluginactivation.com/).

= Will plugin X work with Pace Builder? =

We've tried to ensure that Pace Builder is compatible with most plugin widgets. It's best to just download Pace Builder and test for yourself.
